# CCAMLRGIS R package

The CCAMLRGIS package was developed to simplify the production of maps in the CCAMLR Convention Area. It provides two categories of functions: load functions and create functions. Load functions are used to import spatial layers from the online CCAMLR GIS (https://gis.ccamlr.org/) such as the ASD boundaries. Create functions are used to create layers from user data such as polygons and grids.

## Installation

You can install CCAMLRGIS from github with:

```{r , eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ccamlr/CCAMLRGIS",build_vignettes=TRUE)
```


Or from CRAN with:
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("CCAMLRGIS")
```
